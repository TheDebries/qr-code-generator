QR Code generator app
=========================
This repository is for the purpose of applying QR codes to pre-existing images. Configuration is present for aligning the QR code within the image.

* To launch the applet, run "app.py". Make sure the requirements are installed.
* To load an image into the applet, select "load".
* After loading in your template image, you can put in the URL or text you wish to convert into a QR Code.
* Use the "Save" button to generate a proper high-resolution version of the QR Code.
* The configuration of the image, QR Code size and offset can be saved or loaded. Note that the saved configuration retains only the image path, not the full image.

By default, templates are located under data/templates. Configs can be saved to data/configs.
